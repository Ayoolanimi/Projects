Hi, my name is Oseni Olalekan. I am a Nigerian and I presently live in Ibadan, Oyo State, Nigeria. I am a self-taught Data Scientist, Data Analyst and Database Administrator with certifications from several platforms such as Cisco Newtworking Academy, CognitiveAI, etc, exploring the world of Python.
This is a sample GUI project I made mimicking a simple functional ATM machine. This project supports deposit and withdrawal, as well as a prompt to an overdraft if the user input is greater than the available balance which I added to be $10,000. I have comments in the code, walking you through the steps taken to arrive at this system design.
